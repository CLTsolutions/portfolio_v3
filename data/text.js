export const longBioText = `I'm Chelsey, a software engineer who spent twelve years as a flight attendant before
making the switch to tech. I've always had an interest in coding, and when I realized I wanted to be home more,
I finally took the leap and enrolled in a coding bootcamp.

After completing the program, I worked as a learning assistant at the bootcamp, which was perfect for
solidifying what I'd just learned while helping other career changers navigate their own transitions.
A few months later, I landed my first engineering role at a healthcare startup.

I primarily work with React and TypeScript on the frontend, building responsive, accessible user interfaces.
On the backend, I use Ruby on Rails with PostgreSQL databases. I've been involved in building a full-stack
application from the ground up, working across web and mobile platforms. I love the creative aspect of development.
There is something really satisfying about turning ideas into beautiful, functional applications.

When I'm not coding, I can usually be found in my veggie and flower gardens, where I grow everything from melons to
cosmos. Turns out debugging code and figuring out why my cucumbers aren't growing both require the same kind of
persistent problem-solving.`;
